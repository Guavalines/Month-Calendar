### Highlights

This code generates a calendar for the current month and displays it on an HTML page.

The JavaScript code selects the HTML elements for the month, date, and days. It then calculates the current month's first and last days, creates a list of the month names, and uses a for loop to populate the days of the calendar in the correct order.

The HTML code provides a basic layout for the calendar, including divs for the month, date, weekdays, and days. The JavaScript code populates the days div with the correct days for the current month.

Overall, this code dynamically generates a calendar that updates automatically each month, based on the current date.
