# [MONTH CALENDAR](https://guavalines.github.io/Month-Calendar/) â˜œ see here

# Description
This program dynamically generates a calendar for the current month, year, and the days of the week. It then displays it on an HTML page, which updates automatically each month, based on the current date.

# Features

- The JavaScript code selects the HTML elements for the month, date, and days. It then calculates the current month's first and last days, creates a list of the month names, and uses a for loop to populate the days of the calendar in the correct order.
